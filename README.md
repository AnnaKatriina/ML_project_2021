# ML_project_2021

This is a course project for a university-level Machine Learning course in 2021. It compares two methods: Decision trees and Logistic regression. The dataset is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is a well-known dataset commonly used in classification problems and beginner machine learning projects. The dataset is available through the Python machine learning library scikit-learn. The dataset in the library is a copy of the UCI ML Repository Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

There is a lot of room for improvement in this project. Nevertheless, this project holds great importance for me, as it was the first to spark my interest in machine learning and AI. After the ML course, I have been able to contribute to code that applies machine learning algorithms in the field of neuroscience research.
